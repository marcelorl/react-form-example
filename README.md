React crud form example

This is just a piece of a personal project i'm developing.
The main idea is to give you guys a more complete example of how to develop a CRUD form with React, once it is impossible to get it from the internet.

Also, I just want to share everything I have learned within this time.

The main features and tools this project has are:

 - React 15
 - React-redux-form
 - React-router
 - Javascript ES6
 - Webpack
 - webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware
 - Express
 - Sass BEMCSS style
 - Material design lite (Thanks to the awesome [https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-dashboard-lite](material-dashboard-lite) project)
 - eslint
 - json-server
 - protractor w/ faker data
 - phantomjs
 - jasmine
 - dataminr-react-components
 - i18n-react
 - momentjs
 - datatables
 - axios
 

## How does it works?

To get the project up and running, run the following commands:

 - npm install
 - npm run server (json file working as a database, the only  restful request available is `shop`)
 - npm start
 
To run the ui tests:

 - npm start
 - npm run server
 - npm test
 
 It has only one form which CRUD my Shop model. I think it is an enough example to give you a brief example how things should work.
 Unfortunately the project is translated to portuguese, but I don't think that you will miss anything.
